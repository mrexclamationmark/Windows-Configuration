**Please read the files and make backups before using them.**

Here is a bunch of windows customization scripts for windows performance tuning, please read the files, it is very important.

Note that some security programs are removed (windows defender, windows firewall), usually the best antivirus is common sense "insert year", but you can use third party anti virus and/or third party firewall or an external firewall.

It is best to use these scripts after you installed all drivers, software and done all your configuration/setup needs in the windows control panels.

**Testing:**

These files were tested under stock Windows 10 21H2.

**What doesn't work:**

The metro interface does not work, but the right click on the start menu icon works (after waiting 1-2 minutes, as it seems to hang at start).
